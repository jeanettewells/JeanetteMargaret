                        <p>My name is Jeanette Margaret Wells and I currently attend the School of the Art Institute of
                            Chicago. I
                            aim
                            to explore the dualities of both physical and emotional planes in the broader context of the
                            intersections of art and technology.<br><br>

                            I am experienced in visual communication, branding, typography, concept development,
                            drawing,
                            intermediate coding, and collaboration, among many other disciplines. As a dedicated and
                            open-minded team member, I would be a strong addition to any collaborative
                            environment.<br><br>

                            My body of conceptual work is the reconstruction of aftermath. It incorporates clean,
                            architectural, design-based elements to investigate the origin of experience through a
                            secondary
                            source. Using design as a tool for detachment, my work speaks primarily about human
                            experience
                            and what results from it.<br><br>

                            My work focuses largely on the illness of my deceased father, something that originated
                            physically but has created a series of incorporeal effects. By creating ephemera drawn from
                            my
                            experiences, I recreate a feeling or emotion as a tangible thing, rather than represent the
                            origin of that sensation. I aim to create a sense of removal from my own emotions by using
                            the
                            memory of a computer to parallel how my own memories exist. I create in various media, but
                            most
                            of my work results from the outcome of a combination of several types of practices. However,
                            the
                            majority of my work has originated in a digital realm that has, in some way or another,
                            become
                            physical. In this, I take the elusiveness of emotions and memories and make them material.

                            Since my dad has passed, the sunflower has grown to become a symbol for his lasting impact
                            on my entire family. Not only does it represent his brightness in my life, but it mutually
                            stands for our togetherness in his loss. Losing my father so early has shaped who I am, what
                            I create, and why I create. The sunflower serves as a reminder of both his presence and lack
                            there of.
